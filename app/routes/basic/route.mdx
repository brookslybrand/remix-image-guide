# Basic Image Handling in Remix

This is the simplest approach to optimized image loading in Remix. In fact, it barely even uses anything from Remix. It's just good ol' [HTML `img` component][img-mdn] using `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, along with a blurred placeholder image set using the CSS `background` property. The only Remix-y thing we do is exporting a `links` function to preload the placeholder image.

Here's is the result:

<div
  className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4]"
  style={{
    background: `top / contain no-repeat url(${placeholderImgSrc})`,
  }}
>
  <img
    className="w-full"
    alt="A puppy sleeping on it's back with it's mouth slightly open"
    src={fallbackImgSrc}
    sizes="(min-width: 400px) 800px, 100vw"
    srcSet={`${smallImgSrc} 400w, ${mediumImgSrc} 640w, ${largeImgSrc} 800w`}
  />
</div>

And here's what the full code would look like:

```tsx
import placeholderImgSrc from "./sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp";
import fallbackImgSrc from "./sleepy_girl.webp";
import smallImgSrc from "./sleepy_girl_small.webp";
import mediumImgSrc from "./sleepy_girl_medium.webp";
import largeImgSrc from "./sleepy_girl_large.webp";

export function links() {
  return [
    {
      rel: "preload",
      href: placeholderImgSrc,
      as: "image",
    },
  ];
}

export default function Image() {
  return (
    <div
      className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4]"
      style={{
        background: `top / contain no-repeat url(${placeholderImgSrc})`,
      }}
    >
      <img
        className="w-full"
        alt="A puppy sleeping on it's back with it's mouth slightly open"
        src={fallbackImgSrc}
        sizes="(min-width: 400px) 800px, 100vw"
        srcSet={`${smallImgSrc} 400w, ${mediumImgSrc} 640w, ${largeImgSrc} 800w`}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And here is the a video of the image loading:

<video className="w-full" controls src={demoSrc} />

## Image Files

When delivering images on the web, it's important to provide different sizes and formats to ensure the best performance across various devices and network conditions. In this example, we use the [WebP format][webp] for the images, which provides better compression and quality than JPEG and PNG.

You also need multiple images of different sizes to serve the most suitable image based on the viewport size and device pixel ratio.

Providing on-demand optimized images of various formats and sizes is what an [Image CDN][image-cdn] does for you. Since this is just a basic example, we're providing these images manually. This is what we've got:

- `sleepy_girl.jpg`: The original image in JPEG format.
- `sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp`: A small, blurred version of the image that serves as a placeholder while the actual image loads.
- `sleepy_girl.webp`: The fallback image that will be loaded if the browser doesn't support `srcset`.
- `sleepy_girl_small.webp`, `sleepy_girl_medium.webp`, `sleepy_girl_large.webp`: Different sizes of the image to be loaded based on the viewport size and device pixel ratio.

## Generating the Images

We use [ffmpeg][ffmpeg] to generate these images from an original photo. The command below scales the image to a specific width (in pixels) and sets the image quality (`-q:v`) to 80 (out of 100) to reduce the file size:

```sh
$ ffmpeg -i ./sleepy_girl.jpg -vf scale=200:-1 -q:v 80 ./sleepy_girl.webp
```

The placeholder image is created by scaling down the original image and applying a box blur effect:

```sh
$ ffmpeg -i ./sleepy_girl.jpg -vf "scale=iw/10:-1,boxblur=5:1" ./sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp
```

The resulting file structure looks like this:

```
├── sleepy_girl.jpg
├── sleepy_girl.webp
├── sleepy_girl_small.webp
├── sleepy_girl_medium.webp
├── sleepy_girl_large.webp
└── sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp
```

## The Placeholder

We render the placeholder image using the CSS `background` property. This approach provides a smooth user experience as the placeholder is instantly replaced by the actual image once it's loaded. To avoid cumulative layout shift (CLS), it's crucial to provide the proper width and an [aspect ratio][aspect-ratio]:

```jsx
<div
  className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4]"
  style={{
    background: `top / contain no-repeat url(${placeholderImgSrc})`,
  }}
>
  <img />
</div>
```

<div
  className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4]"
  style={{
    background: `top / contain no-repeat url(${placeholderImgSrc})`,
  }}
/>

## Preloading the Placeholder

To ensure the placeholder image loads as quickly as possible, we preload it using the [`links` export for the route][remix-links-export]:

```js
export function links() {
  return [
    {
      rel: "preload",
      href: placeholderImgSrc,
      as: "image",
    },
  ];
}
```

This guaruntees that this image will start loading first

<img
  className="w-full"
  alt="A network waterfall showing sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp loading before sleepy_girl_large.webp"
  src={preloadingImgSrc}
/>

## The `srcset` and `sizes` Attributes

The [`srcset`][srcset-mdn] attribute allows the browser to choose the most suitable image source based on the viewport size and device pixel ratio. The [`sizes`][sizes-mdn] attribute informs the browser about the displayed size of the image. While it's possible to manually set these values, it's recommended to have them programmatically created for a more efficient loading strategy:

```jsx
<img
  className="w-full"
  alt="A puppy sleeping on it's back with it's mouth slightly open"
  src={fallbackImgSrc}
  sizes="(min-width: 400px) 800px, 100vw"
  srcSet={`${smallImgSrc} 400w, ${mediumImgSrc} 640w, ${largeImgSrc} 800w`}
/>
```

This is what causes the browser to load the most suitable image based on the viewport size and device pixel ratio, as seen in the demo video above.
