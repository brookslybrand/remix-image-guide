# Basic Image example

Here we have a simple example example using `srcset` and `sizes`, as well as a blurred placeholder image set using the css `background` property.

<div
  className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4]"
  style={{
    background: `top / contain no-repeat url(${placeholderImgSrc})`,
  }}
>
  <img
    className="w-full"
    alt="A puppy sleeping on it's back with it's mouth slightly open"
    src={fallbackImgSrc}
    sizes="(min-width: 400px) 800px, 100vw"
    srcSet={`${smallImgSrc} 400w, ${mediumImgSrc} 640w, ${largeImgSrc} 800w`}
  />
</div>

## Generating the Images

I used [ffmepg][ffmpeg] to generate the various versions of the image

```sh
$ ffmpeg -i ./sleepy_girl.jpg -vf scale=200:-1 -q:v 80 ./sleepy_girl.webp
```

To create these images I took an old photo of my sweet puppy sleeping and converted it to [webp]. I also scaled the image to 400px, 640px, and 800px. Additionally, I set the quality (`-q:v`) to 80 (out of 100) to make the images a little smaller.

I also created a small, placeholder image with blur effect using the following command:

```sh
$ ffmpeg -i ./sleepy_girl.jpg -vf "scale=iw/10:-1,boxblur=5:1" ./sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp
```

These are the files I ended up with:

```
├── sleepy_girl.jpg
├── sleepy_girl.webp
├── sleepy_girl_small.webp
├── sleepy_girl_medium.webp
├── sleepy_girl_large.webp
└── sleepy_girl_placeholder.webp
```
