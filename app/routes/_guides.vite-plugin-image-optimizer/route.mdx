import imgSrc from "./big_ear_for_image_optimizer.jpg";

Note: only runs during the production build.

Maybe ask Pedro: we seem to do a double run of Vite, which means this plugin runs multiple times -- probably only circumvented via caching

APIs to discuss:

- jpg/png objects -- talk about how these Sharp options
- cache/cacheLocation
- logStats?
- includePublic/test/include/exclude -- can't search directories, only file names

vite-image-optimizer is nice for passing over all images and optimizing them
at build. It's useful for small projects and simple blogs, as well as
dealing with SVGs.

Some downsides is that it doesn't convert from one format to another, and it
applies the same optimization to all images. If you're wanting to use srcset
and sizes to ship different images to different devices, you'll need to use
a different tool.

TODO: explain some basic image css tricks

<div className="max-w-[800px] aspect-[3/4] bg-gray-200">
  <img
    className="w-full"
    alt="Cute dog with one big ear up and one flopped down"
    src={imgSrc}
  />
</div>

Screen shots to capture:

- logStats in terminal
- dev vs prod image size
- maybe lower the quality a ton and show the difference?

```ts
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { ViteImageOptimizer } from "vite-plugin-image-optimizer";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    ViteImageOptimizer({
      logStats: true,
      test: /big_ear_for_image_optimizer\.*/,
      jpg: {
        quality: 80,
      },
      cache: true,
      cacheLocation: "node_modules/.cache",
    }),
    remix(),
  ],
});
```
